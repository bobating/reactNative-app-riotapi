## RIOT GAMES MOBILE APP ðŸ¤–
This is a simple mobile app using riot game's API on React Native

you will need a RIOT DEVELOPERS account to use this, the API KEY is generated and that lasts ONLY 24 HOURS ðŸ˜­

NOTE: Newer profile icons starting 2022 season will not work with the app, I believe the API documentation changed for newer profile icons
Thus showing up blank, however older icons will still work.
